# Double negation is a handy Ruby idiom to assure a value is a boolean, as there
# is no to_bool/to_boolean/to_b method. What the cop suggest, !var.nil?, doesn't
# even cater for boolean false as input.

# Single quotes being faster is hardly measurable and only affects parse time.
# Enforcing double quotes reduces the times where you need to change them
